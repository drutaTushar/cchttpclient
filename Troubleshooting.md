● ✅ Fixed! The installation issue is now resolved. Here's what the problem was and how it was fixed:

The Problem:
- UV was using cached wheel files that contained the old shell-script-based init_main.py
- The build directory also contained outdated files
- Even after reinstalling, UV was using the cached version instead of building from the latest source

The Solution:
1. Cleaned build artifacts: rm -rf build/ dist/ src/dynamic_cli.egg-info/
2. Cleared caches: uv cache clean and pip cache purge
3. Fresh installation: uv tool uninstall dynamic-cli && uv tool install .

Now working correctly:
- dynamic-cli-init --help shows proper help
- dynamic-cli-init /path/to/project creates projects successfully
- Pure Python implementation without shell script dependencies
- All four utilities available: dynamic-cli, dynamic-cli-admin, dynamic-cli-init, dynamic-cli-mcp

The key was clearing UV's cache - it had cached the old wheel with the shell-script version and kept reinstalling that instead of building fresh from your updated source code.
